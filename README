NAME
    Regru::API - The great new Regru::API!

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSYS
        my $client = Regru::API->new(username => 'test', password => 'test');
        my $response = $client->nop;

        if ($response->is_success) {
            say $response->get('user_id');
        }
        else {
            die "Error code: " . $response->error_code . ", Error text: " . $response->error_text;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    API calls are divided into categories - user, domain, zone, etc. Each
    category is stored in it's own namespace, and can be accessed through
    $client->$namespace method. For example,

        $client->user->nop

    makes call to user/nop API method
    <https://www.reg.ru/support/help/API-version2#user_nop>

    All API methods return Regru::API::Response object.

        my $response = $client->domain->get_premium;

        if ($response->is_success) {
            # answer params can be get with C<$response->get($param_name)> method
            my $domains = $response->get('domain');
            for my $domain_info (@$domains) {
                say "Name: " . $domain_info->{ name } . ", price: " . $domain_info->{ price };
            }
        }
        else {
            ... 
        }

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
        my $client = Regru::API->new(username => 'test', password => 'test');
        my $response = $client->nop;
        # another cool code here...

        # and without authentication:
        my $client = Regru::API->new;

        my $response = $client->user->nop; # user/nop doesn't require authentication
        say 'ok' if $response->is_success;

    Another options for new():

    lang
        Sets language for error messages.

            my $client = Regru::API->new(username => 'test1', password => 'test', lang => 'ru');
            print $client->nop->error_text; # will print "Ошибка аутентификации по паролю"

    io_encoding
        Sets encoding for input and output data.

            my $client = Regru::API->new(
                username    => 'test',
                password    => 'test',
                io_encoding => 'cp1251'
            );
            my $response = $client->user->create(
                user_login      => 'othertest',
                user_password   => '111',
                user_email      => 'test@test.ru',
                user_first_name => $cp1251_encoded_name
            );

    debug
        Debug messages will be printed to STDERR.

            my $client = Regru::API->new(debug => 1);

  nop
    Does nothing, for testing purpose. Returns user_id and login for
    authorized_clients.

        my $response = $client->nop;
        if ($response->is_success) {
            my $user_id = $response->get('user_id');
            my $login = $response->get('login');
        }
